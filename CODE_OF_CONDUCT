Contributors' Code of Conduct
=============================
In the complete interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we all
pledge to make participating in our project and our community a harassment-free
experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity,
gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery
* Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

The project maintainers are responsible for further clarifying the standards of
acceptable behavior when needed, and are expected to take an appropriate and
fair corrective action in response to any instance of unacceptable behavior.

The project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban, whether on temporary
or permanent basis, any contributor for other behaviors for which they deem
inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing the project or community include using any official project e-mail
addresses, posting via any official social media accounts, or acting as an
appointed representative at any online or offline event. Representation of a
project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

Any instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviors may be
reported by contacting any member of the project team individually, or by
sending an email to ikaheishi@ikaheishi.net.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, and will result in a response
that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team
is absolutely obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter
of an incident.

Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Any project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in
good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.4,
